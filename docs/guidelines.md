**Total Starting Capital**: 480 Bank Points (configurable)

## 1. Coin Valuation (The Exchange Rate)

All values are configurable through the parent configuration panel:
- **1 Rupee Coin** = 10 Bank Points
- **2 Rupee Coin** = 20 Bank Points  
- **50 Paisa Coin** = 5 Bank Points
- **25 Paisa Coin** = 2 Bank Points
